Darrell,  I just wanted to let you know that Jim had a massive stroke/aneurysm on Saturday morning and passed away Saturday evening.  He had willed his body to Science so there will not be a funeral at this time.  We are planning a memorial service for sometime in June and I will let you know a date as soon as plans are complete.    Sue Putman and Family

update

Carolyn Ross has been moved back to assisted living.  There was not an opening in Ogallala or Grant, so she is in North Platte. 
The new address is Carolyn Ross    3700 West Philip Ave.   #120
                                                     North Platte, NE   69101
Her phone number 308-352-2742
 
I saw Wayne Spangler two weeks ago and he has had a slight stroke.  He can still drive.  He said it has slowed down his coffee drinking but is doing therapy to hopefully get better.
 
David Brunswig lost his brother Bob on Sept 12, 2017.  Bob retired and moved to Tucson. AZ in 2003.  We extend our sympathy to Dave and his family.
 
That is all for now.

Carolyn Harmonson Ross

Carolyn had surgery yesterday (6-14-2017) at Un. of Neb Medical Center in Omaha to remove a spot on her lung that was cancer.  Her mother called me this morning and said every thing went well with the surgery and Carolyn was up and sitting in a chair this morning.  Unless something changes they plan to keep her in Omaha for a week and bring her back to the Perkins County Hospital in Grant to continue recovery.  I asked about cards and Irene said sent them to Grant since she should be here in a few days.
 
We don't have all class members on the email list so if you are in contact with other members tell them about Carolyn.
 
That is all for now

Hi OHS60 class members,

In an attempt to sort of 'keep up' with class members, prepared sort of a reference/archive website with four files on it. The URL is:

github.com/pmterry/OHS60

At this URL, the README.md file is always open. It describes how to navigate/use the site. The files will be updated as appropriate.

I note, D. Pierce provided much information for the files.

I welcome any comments, will make any changes suggested by anyone.

If anyone knows how/if one can group email addresses so that one could, in *one* copy and paste step, paste all the email addresses for an emailing to the class, I would implement it?

I note, Facebook, Twitter, etc. may be good for something like this (github not as straight forward/easy to use). At this time, github definitely needed for bioinformatics research, so am working with it.


Thx & Best,

Mike Terry

A note FOLLOWING the emailing: of the 43 email addresses this message was sent to, three were returned undeliverable. They were:

Anderson, Sharon (Frickey) rfrickey@nebnet.net

Cobaugh, Joyce jaseffron@verizon.net

Fulcher, Ben benvesta@msa.com


Of the 40 deliverable emails, since one person has two addresses on the list, 39 different persons received the email.

## 08/25/16

Thanks for the note Darrell. It's always interesting to hear bits of information about classmates. Perhaps one of these days I will stop resisting Facebook. 

Wishing the best for all of you,
Jerry Williams

Last Wednesday night 6 of us had supper with Mike Terry  in Ogallala.  He was going to Ft. Collins to visit Charles Smith.  Mike and Charles were going to climb a fourteener.  Mike has recovered from the bike accident he had last summer that put him on crutches for our class reunion in September.
 
On a sad note Margaret Ronneker Hein died the first part of August.  She was in our class for two years and graduated from Grant High School in 1960.  She is survived by two sons and sisters Cathy and Karen.
 
No more news,
